Download the above file, **unzip it**, and drag the resulting **`Farm`** folder to your **Desktop**.    The Farm folder contains the following subdirectories:

```bash
Farm/
	Coop/ 
		Chickens/
		Geese/
	Stable/
		Horses/
```

**From this point forward, ONLY use the terminal to accomplish the following:**

1. Open a new terminal window. Navigate to the `Farm` folder.
2. List the contents of the `Farm` directory.
3. "Move" into the `Coop` folder.
4. List the contents of the `Coop` folder.
5. "Move" into the `Chickens` folder.
6. List out the chickens in the `Chickens` folder.  How many are there?
7. One of the chickens is very very old, which one is it? (which file in the `Chickens` folder has the oldest modification time?) Use a command to figure it out!
8. In a **single** command, move from the `Chickens` directory to the `Geese` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above if needed.
9. How many geese (files) are in the `Geese` directory?
10. One of the geese is sitting on a golden egg!  It's larger than the other geese. Which one is it?  (which file in the `Geese` folder is the largest?).  Use a command to figure it out!
11. Navigate to the `Horses` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above, if needed.
12. How many horses are in the `Horses` directory?
13. Wait! There is a hidden horse in the `Horses` directory! What is it's name?? 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Bonus:** List out the contents of the `Horses` directory as a comma separated list.  You'll need to dig into the man pages to find the correct option.  Perhaps search the `ls` man page for "comma"?
